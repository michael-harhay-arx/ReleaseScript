Release script:
- Purpose is to allow for quicker/cleaner releases
- Can run after committing in develop branch

Features
1. Checkout release branch, merge target branch into release (make release branch if doesn't exist)
2. Run compile script with questionnaire. Pulls previous DLL version, before asking for info about version update (major/minor revision)
3. Ask for release notes (point form description of release)
4. Finish running script to generate DLL (C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\CVI2019 --> compile.exe, can run with /? for help)
5. Parse output of compile.exe to validate successful compilation
6. If successful, copy new DLL to dedicated DLL folder
7. Make a new commit on release branch with new DLL, add release notes to commit message.
8. Run CI/CD (if implemented), rebuild DLL if necessary
